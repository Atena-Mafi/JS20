   what is the difference between an asynchronous function and a synchronous function?
*/

// ! Answer

// An asynchronous function doesn't wait for the action that take times and it moves on to execute other parts of the code while waiting for the result. A synchronous function read and executes the code line by line, waiting for each line to complete before moving to the next one.
